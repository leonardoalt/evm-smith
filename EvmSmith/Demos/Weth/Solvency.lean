# Weth — solvency invariant, top-level theorem (§2.6)

`weth_solvency_invariant` — after any single Ethereum transaction, the
Weth contract at `C` remains solvent: the sum of user-balance storage
slots is at most `C`'s ETH balance.

This file mirrors `EvmSmith/Demos/Register/BalanceMono.lean`'s
composition pattern. Like Register, Weth's top-level proof composes:

* `Υ_invariant_preserved` (§1.3, in `EVMYulLean/EvmYul/Frame/UpsilonFrame.lean`),
  the framework's transaction-level invariant-preservation theorem
  for the relational `storageSum ≤ balanceOf` invariant.
* A bundle of **structural hypotheses** packaging the call-tree-level
  facts that aren't derivable from the closed framework outputs.

## Hypotheses (from `SOLVENCY_PLAN.md` and `ASSUMPTIONS.md`)

The boundary hypotheses (`hWF`, `hS_T`, `hBen`, `hValid`, `hInv`)
are the same shape as Register's `register_balance_mono`. The Weth
analogues of Register's `RegSDExclusion` / `RegDeadAtσP` are bundled
in `WethAssumptions`:

1. **`DeployedAtC C`** — Weth's bytecode is installed at `C`. Real
   world: genesis-deployment + Weth bytecode contains no
   CREATE/CREATE2/SELFDESTRUCT, so `C`'s code is preserved across
   any sub-frame (mirror of Register's `DeployedAtC`).

2. **`WethSDExclusion`** — no SELFDESTRUCT in the call tree adds `C`
   to the final substate's selfDestructSet. Holds because Weth's
   bytecode contains no SELFDESTRUCT and SELFDESTRUCT only inserts
   the executing-frame address `Iₐ` into the SD-set, which by
   `DeployedAtC` is `≠ C` whenever the code at that address is not
   Weth's. Same shape as `RegSDExclusion`.

3. **`WethDeadAtσP`** — `C`'s account in σ_P (the post-Θ/Λ state)
   has non-empty code (Weth's bytecode), so `State.dead σ_P C =
   false`. Holds because `WethInv σ C` (which provides the bytecode
   identity) is preserved through the value-debit at `S_T ≠ C` and
   `lambda_derived_address_ne_C` rules out CREATE-derivation of `C`.
   Same shape as `RegDeadAtσP`.

4. **Bytecode-level cascade-fact hypotheses** (`pc40_cascade`,
   `pc60_cascade`, `pc72_cascade`) — the `ΞPreservesInvariantAtC C`
   witness is derived inline by `bytecodePreservesInvariant` (in
   `BytecodeFrame.lean`) from these structural facts via the
   `weth_sstore_preserves_from_cascades` and
   `weth_call_slack_from_cascade` glue lemmas. The non-halt step
   closure (formerly the `step_closure` field) is derived in-Lean by
   `weth_step_closure` (aggregating the 61 per-PC walks); the
   op-classification (formerly `op_reach`) is also in-Lean
   (`WethReachable_op_in_allowed`). The cascade-fact predicates
   `WethPC{40,60,72}CascadeFacts` capture exactly the per-PC
   trace-cascade data needed for the SSTORE / CALL discharge — this
   refines the previous opaque `WethSStorePreserves` / `WethCallSlack`
   fields to the precise narrower predicates the trace cascade
   extension would establish (PC 48 SLOAD → PC 60 SSTORE → PC 72 CALL
   propagation; see `BytecodeFrame.lean`'s `WethPC60CascadeFacts`
   docstring for the cascade roadmap).

5. **`WethInvAtσP`** — σ_P (Υ's post-Θ/Λ-dispatch state) preserves
   the relational solvency invariant `storageSum σ_P C ≤ balanceOf
   σ_P C`. Mirror of Register's `σ_to_σP_balance_mono_Θ`/`Λ` chain
   for the relational invariant. Discharging from Lean requires
   exposed `Θ_invariant_preserved` / `Λ_invariant_preserved`
   framework theorems (currently private inside MutualFrame.lean);
   bundled here as a structural hypothesis.

The body decomposition existence (`σ' = Υ_tail_state σ_P g' A …`)
is **NOT** a structural hypothesis — it is derived mechanically
inline by `weth_Υ_body_factors` from inspecting Υ's `.ok` output
shape, exactly as in Register's `register_Υ_body_factors`.

The remaining decomposition into structural hypotheses follows
Register's posture: real-world facts captured precisely, with
discharge deferred to the relevant framework strengthening pass.

Υ's `.ok` output, vacuous on `.error`. -/

  | .ok (_, A, _, _) => ∀ k ∈ A.selfDestructSet.1.toList, k ≠ C
  | _ => True

σ_P that decomposes Υ's output via the tail-state form satisfies
`State.dead σ_P C = false`. Mirror of Register's `RegDeadAtσP`. -/
def WethDeadAtσP (σ : AccountMap .EVM) (fuel H_f : ℕ)

        σ' = Υ_tail_state σ_P g' A' H H_f tx S_T →
        State.dead σ_P C = false
  | _ => True

/-- Hypothesis: σ_P (Υ's post-Θ/Λ-dispatch state) preserves Weth's
solvency invariant. This is the σ-to-σ_P propagation step, analogous
to Register's `σ_to_σP_balance_mono_Θ`/`Λ` chain but for the
relational `storageSum ≤ balanceOf` invariant.

Discharging inside Lean requires exposed
`Θ_invariant_preserved`/`Λ_invariant_preserved` framework theorems
(currently private in `MutualFrame.lean`, bundled inside

/-- **Weth assumptions bundle.** Packages the structural hypotheses
for the top-level solvency theorem.

Mirror of Register's `(hDeployed, hSDExcl, hDeadAtσP)` triple, with
Weth-specific additions:

* `inv_at_σP` — σ_P preserves the invariant.
* `pc40_cascade`, `pc60_cascade`, `pc72_cascade` — the per-PC
  cascade-fact predicates (in `BytecodeFrame.lean`) capturing the
  precise trace-cascade data the SSTORE / CALL dischargers need.
  These derive `WethSStorePreserves` and `WethCallSlack` via the
  closed-form glue (`weth_sstore_preserves_from_cascades`,
  `weth_call_slack_from_cascade`), which then derive
  `ΞPreservesInvariantAtC C` via `bytecodePreservesInvariant`. This
  replaces the previous opaque `WethSStorePreserves` / `WethCallSlack`
  fields with narrower per-PC predicates that match the shape of the
  pending trace cascade extension. The non-halt step closure and the
  op-classification are discharged in-Lean (`weth_step_closure`,
  `WethReachable_op_in_allowed`).

The decomposition existence (`σ' = Υ_tail_state σ_P g' …`) is
mechanical and is derived inline by `weth_Υ_body_factors`; combined
with `inv_at_σP` and `dead_at_σP` they form the
`ΥBodyFactorsInvariant` predicate `Υ_invariant_preserved` consumes. -/

  added to C's balance by Θ before Ξ entered, so the post-SSTORE
  storageSum (= storageSum + msg.value) is bounded by the post-Θ
  balance. **Cannot be derived from bytecode walks alone** — it
  lives in the framework's outer Θ/Λ layer.

  Note: the previous `deposit_cascade : WethDepositCascadeStruct C`

  This **replaces** the previous opaque `account_at_C : WethAccountAtC C`
  field. `WethAccountAtC` is now a **theorem** (`weth_account_at_C`),
  discharged via the σ-has-C conjunct now embedded in `WethReachable`.
  The remaining structural fact is just σ-presence at the *initial*
  state — strictly narrower (one bit at one moment vs. an existential
  per every reachable state).

  Real-world justification: Λ enters Weth at C with σ[C] = some acc
  (framework guarantee). Combined with `xi_preserves_C` below, this
  feeds the σ-conjunct of `WethReachable` through the entire X loop. -/

  /-- `WethInvFr` at Ξ entry: at every state at which Ξ is invoked at C
  with `I.codeOwner = C`, the relational invariant `storageSum σ C ≤
  balanceOf σ C` holds.

  Real-world justification: Ξ's pre-state σ at `I.codeOwner = C` is
  always a state where the framework's outer Θ/Λ chain has already
  established the invariant (the top-level `weth_solvency_invariant`'s
  `hInv` precondition; the framework's invariant chain through Θ/Λ
  preserves it).

  Bundled as a structural assumption pending the closed-form discharge
  via the framework's `Ξ_invariant_preserved_bundled_bdd`. -/

                          I.codeOwner = C → WethInvFr σ C
  /-- `WethInvFr` is preserved per CALL step (PC 72).

  This is the genuinely-non-derivable per-step preservation case:
  the framework's `step_CALL_arm_at_C_slack_invariant` (private)
  threads the post-CALL invariant via the strong-induction IHs
  `ΞInvariantAtCFrame C (f+1)` and `ΞInvariantFrameAtC C (f+1)`,
  which the framework's `hReach_step` slot does not expose to the
  per-step interface.

  The previous `inv_step_pres : WethStepInvFrPreserves C` field has
  been **narrowed** to this CALL-specific predicate: the strict + SSTORE
  branches of `WethStepInvFrPreserves` are now discharged in-Lean by
  `weth_inv_step_pres` (which combines `EVM_step_strict_preserves_WethInvFr`
  with `weth_sstore_preserves_pc{40,60}_from_cascade`), leaving only
  the CALL branch as the remaining structural assumption. -/
  call_inv_step_pres : WethCALLStepInvFr C
  /-- **Non-C arm of Ξ-preservation of σ-presence at C.** Ξ executions
  on contracts **other than C** preserve `accountPresentAt σ C`.

  This **replaces** the previous, strictly stronger `xi_preserves_C :
  ΞPreservesAccountAt C` field. The full `ΞPreservesAccountAt C` is now
  derived in `BytecodeFrame.lean` as a Lean theorem
  (`weth_xi_preserves_C`) via the framework's
  `Ξ_preserves_account_at_a_of_Reachable_for_C_with_pres_step` (§J.6.7),
  with `WethReachable C` as the Reachable predicate. The C-arm is fully
  closed-form; the non-C arm — Ξ executions where the running contract's
  bytecode is unknown to us — is bundled here.

  Real-world justification: Weth's bytecode has no SELFDESTRUCT and no
  CREATE/CREATE2; SELFDESTRUCT in any other contract removes only the
  running address `Iₐ ≠ C`; CREATE/CREATE2 only insert. So C's account
  is never removed by non-C executions. A framework-level discharge
  would require `EVM_step_preserves_codeOwner` plus "non-Iₐ accounts
  are preserved by SELFDESTRUCT" — neither currently in
  `MutualFrame.lean`. -/

/-! ## Top-level solvency theorem

The headline result. Mirror of Register's `register_balance_mono`. -/

/-- **Weth solvency: the contract is always solvent across any
transaction.**

Given:
* `hWF`           — pre-state well-formedness (T1, T5).
* `hInv`          — pre-state invariant (`storageSum σ C ≤
                    balanceOf σ C`).
* `hS_T`          — `C` is not the transaction sender.
* `hBen`          — `C` is not the block beneficiary (kept for
                    parity with Register; the invariant chain doesn't
                    actually require it for the storage-sum side, but
                    `Υ_tail_balanceOf_ge`'s β-side does).
* `hValid`        — strengthened transaction-validity (sender funds
                    cover gasLimit·p + value).
* `hAssumptions`  — the `WethAssumptions` bundle (deployed code,
                    SD-exclusion, dead-at-σP, σ_P-invariant, plus
                    per-PC cascade-fact predicates for the PC 40 /
                    60 SSTORE and PC 72 CALL discharges).

Conclusion: Υ's post-state σ' satisfies `WethInv σ' C` (or Υ
returned `.error`, in which case the conclusion is vacuous).

The proof is direct composition: `Υ_invariant_preserved` consumes
`ΞPreservesInvariantAtC C` (from the bundle), `ΥTailInvariant`
(projected via `weth_Υ_tail_invariant`), and `ΥBodyFactorsInvariant`
(projected via `weth_Υ_body_factors`).

`WethInv` and `WethInvFr` (the framework's underlying predicate) are
definitionally equal — both unfold to `storageSum σ C ≤ balanceOf σ
C`. The conclusion is restated using the demo-side `WethInv`. -/
