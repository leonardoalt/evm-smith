# Groth16 verifier — the spec, as an interface

In the style of `Demos/Weth/Spec.lean`: a single `structure Groth16Spec`
whose fields *are* this contract's guarantees, with **no proofs** — the
witness lives in `SpecProofs.lean` (`groth16_spec_sorry`, named to flag
that, unlike `weth_spec`, it is not yet a complete proof). Vocabulary
(`Calls`, `ensures`, `PairingProductHolds`, `SnarkvCorrect`, …) is in
`SpecDSL.lean` / `Spec/Dsl.lean`.

## The contract (904 bytes of runtime code, one public input)

| Selector     | Shape                                                                | Behaviour |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `0x43753b4d` | `verifyProof(uint256[2],uint256[2][2],uint256[2],uint256[1])`        | relays the `alt_bn128` pairing check for this proof/verifying-key |

`Calls .verifyProof s` means `s` is the entry of a call to `verifyProof`;
`ensures …` is the postcondition of running to halt.

/-- **This contract's guarantees, as an interface.** Each field is a
behaviour the bytecode is meant to obey. Unlike `WethSpec`, the headline
field (`verifies`) is *conditional*, on its second branch, on an explicit,
named, and — per the module docstring in `SpecDSL.lean` —
**unprovable-in-this-repo** assumption about the `SNARKV` precompile. That
is the honest ceiling for a tool that proves bytecode-to-spec correctness
without a BN254 pairing formalisation: it can show the contract *correctly
relays* `SNARKV`'s answer, not that `SNARKV`'s answer is cryptographically
meaningful. -/
structure Groth16Spec where
  /-- **`verifyProof` is total on the public input's canonicality, by case
  split.** For *every* call (no precondition on `publicInput` at all), one
  of the two branches below applies — `publicInput < r` and `r ≤
  publicInput` are jointly exhaustive for any `UInt256`, so together these
  two implications characterise the *entire* domain, not just a fragment of
  it:

  * **Non-canonical input (`r ≤ publicInput`) reverts — unconditionally,
    no precompile assumption needed.** `checkField` (`Program.lean`)
    catches this before any precompile is ever called: `EC_MUL` aliases
    `input` and `input + r` (since `r·P = O`), so a non-canonical input
    would otherwise verify identically to the canonical one — see
    `Program.lean`'s docstring.

  * **Canonical input (`publicInput < r`), given the precompiles behave,
    relays the pairing check.** If `BN_MUL` and `BN_ADD` succeed on the
    (well-formed) inputs this contract feeds them, and `SNARKV` answers
    correctly (`SnarkvCorrect`), then the returned boolean is exactly the
    pairing-product check over the eight points this contract assembles:
    `(-A, B), (alpha, beta), (vk_x, gamma), (C, delta)` — where `vk_x` is
    whatever `BN_ADD` computed (its arithmetic is *not* characterised
    here, only that it didn't fail; see `SpecDSL.lean`). This is the
    branch still gated on `SnarkvCorrect` et al. -/

  /-- **This contract never writes storage**, on *any* call (matching
  selector or not), regardless of what the precompiles return — it is a
  `view` function from its first instruction to its last. Needs no
  precompile assumption (see `EntryPoints.lean`'s `program_has_no_sstore`,
  which is proved outright, no `sorry`); only the lifting of that bytecode
  fact through `evmRun`'s step-by-step execution is left as the engineering
  work tracked by `groth16_spec_sorry`. -/
